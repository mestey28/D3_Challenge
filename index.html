          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between % of population that smokes and Age</h2>
          <p>Even with all of years of research showing how terrible smoking is, at least 15-20% of the population continues to be a slave to nicotine. 
            The average age of smokers is 35-40 years of age.</p>
          <h3>Who is most likely to become addicted?</h3>

          <li><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/tobacco-and-cancer/why-people-start-using-tobacco" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</li></a>

          <p>  Anyone who starts using tobacco can become addicted to nicotine. Studies show that smoking is most likely to become a habit during the teen years. 
            The younger you are when you begin to smoke, the more likely you are to become addicted to nicotine.</p>
            
           <p> According to the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report,(SGR) nearly 9 out of 10 adult smokers started before age 18, and nearly all started by age 26. 
           The report estimates that about 3 out of 4 high school smokers will become adult smokers – even if they intend to quit in a few years.</p>
            
            <h3>According to the 2012 Surgeon General’s Report:</h3>
            
            “Of every 3 young smokers, only 1 will quit, and 1 of those remaining smokers will die from tobacco-related causes. Most of these young people never considered the long-term health consequences associated with tobacco use when they started smoking; and nicotine, a highly addictive drug, causes many to continue smoking well into adulthood, often with deadly consequences.”</p>
